This is tahoe-deps.

This is a collection of dependent libraries for Tahoe-LAFS. The packages
here provide all of the automatically-installable prerequisites for Tahoe-LAFS
as of version 1.8.2 (including things needed by its dependent libraries, like
pycryptopp and zfec). The Tahoe-LAFS build process will download and build any
libraries that are not already available on the system: by unpacking this
tahoe-deps bundle into your Tahoe-LAFS source tree, you can avoid the download
step. This is useful if you want to build Tahoe-LAFS while not attached to a
network, a situation referred to as the "desert island build".

The tahoe-deps tarball (of which this README is a part) will unpack
into a tahoe-deps/ directory. The Tahoe build process (i.e. 'make build' or
'python setup.py build_tahoe') will fetch dependent library tarballs from
./tahoe-deps/ or ../tahoe-deps/ before it tries to download them from PyPI.
