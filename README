This is tahoe-lafs-deps.

This is a collection of dependent libraries for Tahoe-LAFS. The packages here
provide all of the automatically-installable prerequisites for Tahoe-LAFS as of
version 1.9.1 (including things needed by its dependent libraries, like
pycryptopp and zfec). The Tahoe-LAFS build process will download and build any
libraries that are not already available on the system: by unpacking this
tahoe-lafs-deps bundle into your Tahoe-LAFS source tree, you can avoid the
download step. This is useful if you want to build Tahoe-LAFS while not
attached to a network, a situation referred to as the "desert island build".

The tahoe-lafs-deps tarball (of which this README is a part) will unpack into a
tahoe-deps/ directory. The Tahoe build process (i.e. 'make build' or 'python
setup.py build_tahoe') will fetch dependent library tarballs from ./tahoe-deps/
or ../tahoe-deps/ before it tries to download them from PyPI.
